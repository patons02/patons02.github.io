ðŸ‘‹. I'm Stu - a UK based Software Engineer / Engineering Manager with over 10 years experience.

I've decided to make this webpage and blog to give back to the community more as I learn, and grow through my career and new interests bring on good learning.

I hope you decide to stay for the journey.
